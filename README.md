# pygments

Scala library for producing syntax-highlighted text, using the Pygments tool

## Usage

Add the dependency to your project, for [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/):

```scala
val lunatechPublic = "Lunatech Public" at "http://nexus.lunatech.com/content/repositories/lunatech-public/"
val pygments = "org.smop" %% "pygments" % "0.1.4"
```

Or for [Play! 1.2](http://www.playframework.org/):

```yaml
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - play -> scala 0.9
    - org.smop -> pygments_2.8.1 0.1.4
repositories:
    - lunatechPublic:
        type: iBiblio
        root: "http://nexus.lunatech.com/content/repositories/lunatech-public/"
        contains:
            - org.smop -> *
```

Install [pygments](http://pygments.org/) (the Python library/tool) and make sure the `pygmentize` command is on your PATH.

```scala
import org.smop.pygments._

// There is just one implementation currently and it forks the
// commandline tool.
val p: Pygments = new ForkPygmentize

// produces a data structure with information about the languages that
// it recognizes, useful for populating a dropdown menu
val lexers = p.allLexers

// Actually produce a String with html.
val html = p.highlight("val i:Integer = 3", Lexer("scala"), Formatter("html"))
```

It's very easy to experiment on the console. `Formatter("console")` comes in handy there.
